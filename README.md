# [Data Governance: Sharing Data Between and Across Partner Organizations](https://philanthrobotics.pubpub.org/pub/7r17uboe/release/2)
Sharing proposal data among foundations, bilaterally or with a shared commons of grants and proposals, can improve philanthropy.
* For organizations that have more good proposals than they can fund: this can help match them with future support.
* For organizations trying to transform a sector with a new call: this can help them make their outreach and review complementary to other ongoing grant processes and solicitations.

This repository captures the range of agreements used for data sharing between funders, or between funders and researchers helping analyse and visualize proposals and outcomes.  There is also a related [onboarding procedure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xiponc02Mb4ImMA3ktJdHuESAHWHdbgt9U4Uz7LTkpg/edit) for organizations learning how to share data with eachother.

# Data Sharing Agreement Index

The following is an index of Data Sharing Agreements across a variety of industries and disciplines. 
This repository is built to aid organizations who seek to have data use agreements in place and are looking for a starting point. 
The repository is broken up into three main pieces:
1. **Template agreements**: these are agreements we have found online that exist from various institutions.
2. **Agreements from Philanthrobotic partners**: Philanthrobotics, the ecosystem of data analysis and machine learning models for philanthropy, is partnering with various organizations to come up with a master Data Use Agreement. To do this, we require a collection of data usage agreements from our partners. These partners include MIT Solve, Lever for Change, and MIT (in lieu of Open Learning). 
3. **Meta-resources for learning more about DUAs**: Many institutional libraries have made presentations on what makes up a good DUA. To add those interested in the process, we include some of these slide decks. 

The institutions and organizations included in this repo are split up into the following org types / file structure. 

| Education         | Government | Life Sciences | Meta Ressources |
