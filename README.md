# Data Sharing Agreement Index

The following is an index of Data Sharing Agreements across a variety of industries and disciplines. 
This repository is built to aid organizations who seek to have data use agreements in place and are looking for a starting point. 
The repository is broken up into three main pieces:
1. **Template agreements**: these are agreements we have found online that exist from various institutions.
2. **Agreements from Philanthrobotic partners**: Philanthrobotics, the ecosystem of data analysis and machine learning models for philanthropy, is partnering with various organizations to come up with a master Data Use Agreement. To do this, we require a collection of data usage agreements from our partners. These partners include MIT Solve, Lever for Change, and MIT (in lieu of open learning). 
3. **Meta-resources for learning more about DUAs**: Many institutional libraries have made presentations on what makes up a good DUA. To add those interested in the process, we include some of these slide decks.
